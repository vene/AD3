    inference on a graph, with one type of node, taking into account logical
    constraints between unaries.

    The constraints must be a list of tuples like:
        ( <operator>, <unaries>, <states>, <negated> )
    The tuple is defined differently for single- and multi-type inference.
    See in each function below.

    where:
    - operator is 1 of the strings: XOR XOROUT ATMOSTONE OR OROUT ANDOUT IMPLY
    - unaries is a list of the index of the unaries involved in this constraint
    - states is a list of unary states, 1 per involved unary.
        If the states are all the same, you can pass it directly as a scalar
        value.
    - negated is a list of boolean indicated if the unary must be negated.
        Again, if all values are the same, pass a single boolean value instead
        of a list

    The graph is binarized as explained in Martins et al. ICML 2011 paper: "An
    Augmented Lagrangian Approach to Constrained MAP Inference".

    - l_states is a list of states per type. Each item is a list of the state
        of the involved unaries.
            If the states are all the same for a type, you can pass it directly
            as a scalar value.
    - l_negated is a list of "negated" per type. Each item is a list of
        booleans indicating if the unary must be negated.
        Again, if all values are the same for a type, pass a single boolean
        value instead of a list
    - the optional (type, unary, state, negated) allows to refer to a certain
        unary of a certain type in a certain state, possibly negated.
        This is the final node of the logic operator, which can be key for
        instance for XOROUT, OROUT, ANDOUT, IMPLY operators.
        (Because the other terms of the operator are grouped and ordered by
        type)
